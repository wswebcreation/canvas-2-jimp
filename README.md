# Canvas 2 Jimp comparison

This repo will hold some examples to replace Canvas with Jimp where we specifically focus on "performance". If Jimp performs almost equally in comparison to Canvas we will investigate replacing Canvas in [`@wdio/visual-testing|webdriver-image-comparison`](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing)

## "Comparison"

I'm running this on a MacBook Pro:

- Chip: Apple M3 Pro
- Memory: 36GB
- Power adapter: charging (running on battery takes 30-40% longer)

## Run Canvas tests

Run

```sh
node run.canvas.js
```
